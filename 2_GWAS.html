<p>This document describes a GWAS realised on the <a href="">IPAQ SCORE</a> data of the <a href="http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk">UKBiobank</a> dataset. It runs the GWAS using both <a href="https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2">Plink</a> and <a href="http://www.thetasolutionsllc.com/bolt-software.html">Bolt</a>. Summary statistics are described. They are then use as input to the <a href="http://fuma.ctglab.nl">FUMA</a> and <a href="http://locuszoom.org/genform.php?type=yourdata">Locus Zoom</a> website for further analysis.</p>

<div id="data-used" class="section level2">
<h2>Data used</h2>
<p>Running a GWAS requires several information:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a <strong>phenotype file</strong>: the phenotype file created by the script in the previous page: <code>/home/y.holtz/BLOOD_GWAS/0_DATA/pheno.txt.gz</code>. It has one line per individual. Its first column is the individual id. Other columns are traits. Traits include the Diastolic blood pressure, <a href="http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/field.cgi?id=4079">field 4079</a> of the UKB.</p></li>
<li>a <strong>genotype file</strong>: gives the alleles at each variants for each individual. Several version exist. HapMap3 has about 2M SNPs. I used the file <code>/afm01/Q0286/UKBiobank/v2EURu_HM3</code>, it keeps only unrelated European people. Note that information is stored using a compressed format and is thus split in three files:
<ul>
<li>.bed (alleles coded 0, 1, 2),</li>
<li>.fam (detail of each SNP like id, cM, bP, All1 and All2),</li>
<li>.bin (detail of each individual (id mainly).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>a <strong>list of PCs</strong>: used to correct for the population structure in plink only. Several PCs are available: computed on 1000 genomes, computed on the UKBâ€¦ In my analysis I used:</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="run-gwas-with-plink" class="section level2">
<h2>run GWAS with Plink</h2>
<p>I run <a href="https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2">plink version 1.9</a> for this analysis. Option used are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>allow-no-sex</strong>: explanation:</li>
<li><strong>linear</strong></li>
<li><strong>PCs correction</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>An array is used to send the calculation for each chromosome in parrallele. This is done thanks to <a href="https://github.com/zhilizheng/qsubshcom">this script</a>.</p>

<h2>run GWAS with bolt</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.thetasolutionsllc.com/bolt-software.html">Bolt</a> takes into account the population structure: it computes a <strong>genomic relationship matrix</strong> (GMR) from the genotype file and use it in the GWAS model. It thus takes way longer than plink, but gives a more precise result. It needs the whole genomic to compute the GMR, thus this analysis cannot be run on one chromosome only.</p>

<h2>Clumping</h2>
<p>Once I have the GWAS result, I have to â€˜clumpâ€™ it: I find all the independant pics of association, find the highest LOD, the markers involved in this pic, the position of the picâ€¦ What does it take into account? It considers:</p>
<ul>
<li>LOD score of each SNP</li>
<li>LD between SNPs</li>
<li>Physical distance between SNPs.</li>

<p>Here are the clumping options Iâ€™ve used:</p>

<li>p1 is the Significance threshold for an association</li>
<li>p2 is Secondary significance threshold for clumped SNPs = SNPs that are part of the association, but not pic.</li>

<p>Same thing zooming around 30 Mb. Knowing that Iâ€™ve clumped using 500kb slices! It means I should not have more than 2 distincts association in each 500kb slices. Letâ€™s watch between 25Mb and 35Mb. This is an area of 10Mb, which is 10,000 k, which is 20 times 500kb. And Iâ€™ve way more than 20 associations here.. So whatâ€™s wrong..</p>
