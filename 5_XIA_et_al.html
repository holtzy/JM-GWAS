<p>To run a GSMR analysis we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A risk factor GWAS summary statistics. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02662-2">Xia et al.</a> recently published a GWAS on Vitamin-D, with a sample size of about 80k people. Let’s load this data, and transfer it on the delta cluster.</li>

<li><p>GWAS summary statistics for diseases we want to explain. I’m gonna consider several sources of information:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>23 diseases comming from a meta-analysis of the UKBiobank and the GERA consortium. Available online <a href="http://cnsgenomics.com/data.html">here</a>. Diseases available are: allergic rhinitis, asthma, cancer ,card depress, dermatophytosis, dia2, dyslipid, hemorrhoids, hernia_abdominopelvic, hyper, insomnia, iron deficiency, irritable bowel, macdegen, ostioa, ostiop, peptic_ulcers, psychiatric, pvd stress, sum diseases, varicose veins). File available here on Inode: <code>ibscratch/users/uqzzhu1/dataset/formatted_meta/combined_ukb_gera*</code></p></li>
<li><p>66 other diseases already used in the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02317-2">GSMR paper by Zhihong et al</a>. These include Alzheimer, depression, neuroticsm, Schizophrenia, Type II Diabete and others. File available here: <code>ibscratch/users/uqzzhu1/dataset/formatted_meta/</code></p></li>

<p>The GWAS has been run on <strong>296998 SNPs</strong>. 521 SNPs showed a significant association (with a 10^-8 threshold). Here is a manhattan plot summarizing the results. The genetic determinism of VitaminD is oligogenic: controlled by a few major loci.</p>

<p>The first step is to get the last GCTA version that support GSMR. Available on the QBI cluster in Zhihong folder (thanks!)</p>

<div id="results" class="section level1">

<p>First I transfer the results locally for further analysis.</p>

<p>Here is how the result of GSMR looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>exposure</strong> is always the Vitamin-D, and we test its causality on several outcomes.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Bxy</strong> is the effect of the exposure on the disease. If this effect is positive, an increase of the exposure creates a increase in the Outcome.</li>
<li><strong>se</strong> is the standard error around Bxy</li>
<li><strong>p</strong> is the pvalue of the association test. A first approach would be to consider the test significant with a usual 0.05 threshold. However we probably need to correct for multiple testing since we run the test several times.</li>
<li><strong>nsnp</strong> is the number of SNP with a significant effect on the Exposure. It is not always the same because a few SNP are sometime discarded by the Heidi outlier test.</li>
</ul>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">5</span> - Conclusion</h1>
<ul>
<li>GSMR analysis reveals that vitamin-D concentration has a causal effect on Hypertension and Allergic Rhinitis. The related effect size are positive, what means that having more vitamin-D increases your chance to develop these 2 diseases.. Does it make sense?</li>
<li>There is a slight link with Iron deficiency and insomnia with a negative size effect. This would make more sense: less vitamin –&gt; more insomnia and less Iron.</li>
<li>Promising result knowing the lack of power we have here (vitamin-D GWAS run with a sample size of 80k people only). Looking forward for the UKB data.</li>
</ul>
