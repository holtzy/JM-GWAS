<u>Abstract</u>:

<br><br><br><br>

<u>Data analysis</u>: this document summarizes the data analysis leading to the results presented in the paper. It is organized as follow:

* *Phenotype description*: explains - how to get the Vitamin-D phenotype - clean it - interaction with period. 
* *run GWAS*: the code I used to run the GWAS with plink and bolot and description of its result.
* *SMR*: description of the SMR pipeline to find putative genes under the discovered SNPs.
* *XIa et al*: description of the previous biggest Vitamin D GWAS

<u>Note</u>: Some of the script described here are computationnaly intensive and thus run on 2 different clusters. See the code below for connection on the cluster. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# ------  DELTA -----------
ssh y.holtz@delta.imb.uq.edu.au
cd /shares/compbio/Group-Wray/YanHoltz/

# Medici on delta:
cd /gpfs/gpfs01/polaris/Q0286/

# ------  INODE -----------
ssh uqyholtz@inode.qbi.uq.edu.au
/ibscratch/wrayvisscher/Yan_Holtz/
