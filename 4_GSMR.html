<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> - Data</h1>
<hr />
<p>To run a GSMR analysis we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A risk factor GWAS summary statistics. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02662-2">Xia et al.</a> recently published a GWAS on Vitamin-D, with a sample size of about 80k people.

Note that a light version of this file (with p&lt;0.1) is available <a href="https://github.com/holtzy/VitaminD-GWAS/tree/master/0_DATA">here</a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>GWAS summary statistics for diseases we want to explain. Iâ€™m gonna consider several sources of information:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>23 diseases comming from a meta-analysis of the UKBiobank and the GERA consortium. Available online <a href="http://cnsgenomics.com/data.html">here</a>. Diseases available are: allergic rhinitis, asthma, cancer ,card depress, dermatophytosis, dia2, dyslipid, hemorrhoids, hernia_abdominopelvic, hyper, insomnia, iron deficiency, irritable bowel, macdegen, ostioa, ostiop, peptic_ulcers, psychiatric, pvd stress, sum diseases, varicose veins). File available here on Inode: <code>ibscratch/users/uqzzhu1/dataset/formatted_meta/combined_ukb_gera*</code></p></li>
<li><p>66 other diseases provided by different publications. These include Alzheimer, depression, neuroticsm, Schizophrenia, Type II Diabete and others. File available here: <code>ibscratch/users/uqzzhu1/dataset/formatted_meta/</code></p></li>
<li><p>24 diseases from a GWAS on UKBiobank. Provided by Angli and Zhihong Zhu. On Delta here: <code>/gpfs/gpfs01/polaris/Q0286/uqzzhu1/ukb_summary</code></p></li>
<li><p>GWAS sumstat from Neales Lab?</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>We set 2 lists of outcomes. A first list with high prior. A second with all the diseases we can find. List decided by John mainly. Here is the detail of these list.</p>
</div>
<div id="run-gsmr" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> - Run GSMR</h1>
<hr />
<p>The first step is to get the last GCTA version that support GSMR. Available on the QBI cluster in Zhihong folder (thanks!)</p>
<pre class="bash"><code># First transfert localy
cd /Users/y.holtz/Desktop
scp uqyholtz@inode.qbi.uq.edu.au:/ibscratch/users/uqzzhu1/code_project/gcta/build/gcta64 .

# Then from locally to delta
cd /Users/y.holtz/Desktop
scp gcta64  y.holtz@delta.imb.uq.edu.au://home/y.holtz/bin</code></pre>
<p>Then I have to prepare a couple of files and run the analysis</p>
<pre class="bash"><code># Specific repo
cd /home/y.holtz/VITAMIND_XIA_ET_AL/3_GSMR

# prepare a file that gives the link to the GWAS result for the risk factor
echo &quot;vitaminD /home/y.holtz/VITAMIND_XIA_ET_AL/1_GWAS/GWAS_vitaminD_XiaEtAL.ma&quot; &gt; gsmr_exposure.txt

cat gsmr_result_vitaminDXiaEtAl_*gsmr | grep -v &quot;Exposure&quot; &gt;&gt;  gsmr_result_vitaminDXiaEtAl.gsmr</code></pre>
<p>First I transfer the results locally for further analysis.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code># Then from locally to delta

</div>
<div id="result" class="section level1 tabset">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> - Result</h1>
<hr />
<p>Here is how the result of GSMR looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>exposure</strong> is always the Vitamin-D, and we test its causality on several outcomes.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Bxy</strong> is the effect of the exposure on the disease. If this effect is positive, an increase of the exposure creates a increase in the Outcome.</li>
<li><strong>se</strong> is the standard error around Bxy</li>
<li><strong>p</strong> is the pvalue of the association test. A first approach would be to consider the test significant with a usual 0.05 threshold. However we probably need to correct for multiple testing since we run the test several times.</li>
<li><strong>nsnp</strong> is the number of SNP with a significant effect on the Exposure. It is not always the same because a few SNP are sometime discarded by the Heidi outlier test.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code># Read gsmr result
gsmr=read.table(&quot;0_DATA/gsmr_result_vitaminDXiaEtAl.gsmr&quot;, header = T)

# Read the meaning of files:
meaning=read.table(&quot;0_DATA/list_diseases_GWAS_sumstat.csv&quot;, header=T, sep=&quot;,&quot;)

# Add the meaning to gsmr result

<div id="effect-size" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Effect size</h2>
<p>And here is a description of the effect sizes (bxy): the effect of the risk factor on the disease. A few observation:</p>
<ul>
<li>8 significant associations (threshold = 0.05 / number of gsmr test = 0.05/85 = 0.00058).</li>
<li>7 of have a positive effect size: more Vitamin-D, more trait.</li>
<li>1 have a negative effect size.</li>
<li>A lot of the significant causal effects concern blood related trait / disease.</li>
